# Provider -> Sterling

A data provider can send messages to the `sterling-connection` middleware,
either in response to a message it received from the middleware or because, for
example, it has new data that it wants Sterling to display.

This page outlines all of the messages that the middleware understands as well
as the effect the message has on the Sterling interface.

## `data`

A message containing new data for Sterling to display and/or changes to make to
any data that is already displayed. Note that once data is visible to the user,
the data itself cannot be changed. Updates can only be applied to a datum's
metadata, which describes a few choice UI components associated with each datum.

#### Payload Fields

All fields are optional.

- `enter` - An array of new data (as [`Datum`](./types#Datum) objects) to
  display in Sterling.
- `update` - An array of updates (as [`DatumMeta`](./types#DatumMeta) objects)
  to apply to existing data in Sterling.
- `exit` - An array of data IDs to remove from display in Sterling.

#### Payload Types

```typescript
{
  enter?: Datum[];
  update?: DatumMeta[];
  exit?: string[];
}
```

#### Examples

In this example, Alloy 5 has generated an instance to display in Sterling. When
the instance is displayed, a "Next" button should be visible that, when clicked
by the user, sends an action back to Alloy with the string "next". Furthermore,
Alloy is able to evaluate expressions for this instance, so the evaluator UI
should be available when viewing the instance.

```json
{
  "type": "data",
  "version": 1,
  "payload": {
    "enter": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "actions": [{ "id": "next", "text": "Next" }],
        "evaluator": true,
        "data": "<alloy>...</alloy>"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Now, let's say that the user clicked the "Next" button and Alloy generated the
next instance to display. The following message instructs Sterling to display
the new instance _and_ to remove the ability to use the evaluator or click the
"Next" button from the previous instance.

```json
{
  "type": "data",
  "version": 1,
  "payload": {
    "enter": [
      {
        "id": "2",
        "actions": [{ "id": "next", "text": "Next" }],
        "evaluator": true,
        "data": "<alloy>...</alloy>"
      }
    ],
    "update": [{ "id": "1", "actions": [], "evaluator": false }]
  }
}
```

Finally, let's say the user has opened a new file in Alloy and generated a new
instance to display in Sterling. The following message will remove all previous
instances from Sterling and display only the new one.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Developers of data providers should carefully consider when it is appropriate
  to remove data from Sterling, as doing so could potentially lead to a bad user
  experience. Customizations the user has made within Sterling, such as graph
  layouts, will not be preserved in any way.
</Callout>

```json
{
  "type": "data",
  "version": 1,
  "payload": {
    "enter": [
      {
        "id": "3",
        "actions": [{ "id": "next", "text": "Next" }],
        "evaluator": true,
        "data": "<alloy>...</alloy>"
      }
    ],
    "exit": ["1", "2"]
  }
}
```

## `eval`

A message that includes the result of evaluating an expression associated with a
specific datum.

#### Payload Fields

- `id` - The ID of the [`eval`](./send#eval) message originally sent from
  Sterling to the provider.
- `result` - The result of the evaluated expression.

#### Payload Types

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  result: string;
}
```

#### Example

```json
{
  "type": "eval",
  "version": 1,
  "payload": {
    "id": "0",
    "result": "{}"
  }
}
```

## `meta`

A message that includes information about a data provider, such as the
provider's name and the types of views it supports.

#### Payload Fields

- `name` - The name of the provider, which will be displayed in various places
  around the Sterling UI. Defaults to `"unknown provider"` if not provided.
- `evaluator` - A boolean indicating whether the data provider provides
  [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
  functionality. If false, the evaluator will be removed from the Sterling UI
  completely. If true, the evaluator will be in Sterling UI and can be enabled
  or disabled on a per-datum basis (see [`data`](#data) for more). The default
  is false.
- `views` - A list of data views the provider supports, in the order they will
  be displayed in the Sterling UI. Defaults to `[]` if not provided, and no
  views will be displayed in the Sterling UI.

#### Payload Types

```typescript
{
  name?: string;
  evaluator?: boolean;
  views?: ("graph" | "table" | "script")[];
}
```

#### Example

```json
{
  "type": "meta",
  "version": 1,
  "payload": {
    "name": "Alloy",
    "evaluator": true,
    "views": ["graph", "table", "script"]
  }
}
```

## `message`

[TODO, low priority] This will allow providers to display a message in the
Sterling status bar.

## `notify`

[TODO, low priority] This will allow providers to display a
[toast](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/feedback/toast) in the Sterling UI.

## `pong`

The `pong` message is one of two messages that does not follow the standard
message format. The other, [`ping`](./send#ping), is used in concert with `pong`
to keep the connection between the middleware and a data provider alive. As
such, when a data provider receives a `ping` message, it should immediately
respond with a `pong`.

#### Example

```
"pong"
```
