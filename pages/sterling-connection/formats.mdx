# Data Formats

Currently Sterling only supports a single data format, the Alloy XML format,
though we working to introduce more.

## Alloy XML

Unfortunately there is no explicit specification for the Alloy XML format (that
I've been able to find), but we'll write what we know in here [TODO: write Alloy
XML format].

#### Format String

`"alloy"`

#### Example Datum

```json
{
  "id": "0",
  "format": "alloy",
  "data": "<alloy>...</alloy>"
}
```
