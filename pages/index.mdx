# Sterling TS Documentation

Welcome! Are you a developer of a tool or service and want to use Sterling to
visualize some data? If so, you'll likely want to go to the
[Sterling Connection](./sterling-connection/introduction) docs to learn how to
communicate with Sterling. Are you a Sterling developer? This is definitely
where you belong, go wild. Are you a Sterling user, looking for some guidance on
how to do something in Sterling? If so then you should probably head to
[the old Sterling page](https://sterling-js.github.io/) which has some things
that might be helpful. (We're working on new guides for new Sterling!)
